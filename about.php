                <p>
                    I recently graduated with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Millersville University of Pennsylvania. 
                    I'm currently seeking opportunities that combine my passions for programming and cybersecurity.

                    During my time at Millersville, I was a member of Millersville University’s Cyber Defense Organization. 
                    During the spring 2021 semester, I was a member of the Windows team for the Mid-Atlantic Cyber Defense Competition (MACCDC). 
                    Eight of us competed in qualifiers, and then in the regional finals where we came in fourth place. 
                    I also participated in the National Cyber League and took classes related to cybersecurity and computer networks.

                    I was also involved in Millersville University's Board Game Club. 
                    As the treasurer, I was in charge of keeping track of our organization's finances through Millersville's banking center, 
                    requesting funding from the Student Government Association, and purchasing funded items for the organization. 
                    I collaborated with the other Board Game Club officers to plan and host campus events open to all students.

                    For my computer science senior project, I worked in a team of five students to create UML diagram software in Python. 
                    During this semester-long project, we gained experience with Agile methodologies including Scrum, peer programming, and code reviews. 
                    If you would like to learn more about that project, there is a page dedicated to it on this website.
