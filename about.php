                                <p id="titleLine">Software Developer</p>
                                <p>Being creative has always been a passion of mine.  I have tried my hand at many different kinds of art including painting, digital art, metal art, and crocheting. When I first began programming, I felt the same sense of fulfillment that I experienced when creating art. I enjoy the problem-solving process, learning how to improve, and being able to use something that I made. Now, I am looking to utilize my knowledge and creativity to help others develop software.</p>
                                <p>If you have an opportunity that you believe I could be a good fit for, I would love to connect.</p>
