                            <p>BunGeney is a Python program that simulates genetic inheritance in rabbits. This program was a collaboration between myself and a student in Millersville University's biology department. It was created to be used in high school and college-level biology classrooms.</p>
                            <h3>My contributions</h3>
                            <p>I created the GUI for BunGeney. This includes the following files: BunGeney.py, BunnyInfo.py, BunnyTable.py, Controller.py, MainWindow.py, Menus.py, TotalsTable.py, README.md, and the rabbit pictures located in the "Pictures" folder.</p>
                            <p>An explanation for downloading and using the program can be found on the project's GitHub page in README.md.</p>
                            <p>The full project can be found on GitHub here:</p>
