                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I recently graduated with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Millersville University of Pennsylvania. I'm currently seeking opportunities that combine my passions for programming and cybersecurity.

                    During my time at Millersville, I was a member of Millersville University’s Cyber Defense Organization. During the spring 2021 semester, I was a member of the Windows team for the Mid-Atlantic Cyber Defense Competition (MACCDC). Eight of us competed in qualifiers, and then in the regional finals where we came in fourth place. I also participated in NCL during my time at Millersville, and took two classes related to cybersecurity and computer networks.

                    For my senior project, I worked in a team of five students to create UML diagram software in Python over the course of a semester. During this project, we gained experience with Agile methodologies including Scrum, peer programming, and code reviews. If you would like to learn more about that project, there is a page dedicated to it on this website.
