            <p>BunGeney is a Python program that simulates genetic inheritance in rabbits. It was created to be used in high school and college-level biology classrooms as part of an independent study project.</p>
            <h2>How to use:</h2>
            <p>The "New Litter" button at the top of the window is used to generate litters of rabbits. The mother and father are determined by user input, which is retrieved using a custom popup window. Once a litter has been generated using genetic inheritance statistics for rabbits, users can view data based on what the program has generated. The data is shown through the tables at the top of the window, the bottom of the window, and the individual rabbit section on the right. The table of buttons at the top of the window both displays data and shows additional data when buttons are clicked. A rabbit's information and picture are shown on the right side of the window when that rabbit's button is clicked. A litter's statistics are shown in the bottom table when that litter's "Offspring of ..." button is clicked.</p>
            <p>A more thorough description of how to use the software can be found in README.md on the project's GitHub.</p>
            <h2>My contributions:</h2>
            <p>I created the GUI for BunGeney. This includes the following files: BunGeney.py, BunnyInfo.py, BunnyTable.py, Controller.py, MainWindow.py, Menus.py, and TotalsTable.py.</p>
            <p>An explanation for downloading and using the program can be found on the project's GitHub page in README.md.</p>
            <p>The full project can be found on GitHub here:</p>
