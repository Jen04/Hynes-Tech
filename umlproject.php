                            <h3>About</h3>
                            <p>For this project, I worked in a team of five students to create UML diagram software in Python. This program was created over the course of a semester. Throughout the project, we used software development concepts including Scrum, sprints, pair programming, and code reviews.</p>
                            <h3>My contributions</h3>
                            <p>For most of the project, my primary tasks involved working on the view and controller for the GUI. I worked on functions throughout all view and controller files, but my main contributions were in ClassWidget.py, MoveClass.py, GUIMainWindow.py, and GUI.py.</p>
                            <p>An explanation for downloading and using the program can be found on the project's GitHub page in README.md.</p>
                            <p>The full project can be found on GitHub here:</p>
