            <p>For this project, I worked in a team of five students to create UML diagram software in Python. This program was created over the course of a semester. Throughout the process, we used various software engineering concepts such as the Agile methodology, Scrum, peer programming, and code reviews.</p>
            <h2>Notable software features include:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility</li>
                <li>GUI and CLI modes</li>
                <li>Model-view-controller design pattern</li>
                <li>CLI: Tab completion</li>
                <li>GUI: Click and drag to move classes</li>
                <li>GUI: Lines re-route to avoid collision with classes</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>My contributions:</h2>
            <p>For most of the project, my primary tasks involved working on the view and controller for the GUI. I worked on various functions throughout all view and controller files, but my main contributions were in ClassWidget.py, MoveClass.py, GUIMainWIndow.py, and GUI.py.</p>
            <p>An explanation for downloading and using the program can be found on the project's GitHub page in README.md.</p>
            <p>The full project can be found on GitHub here:</p>
