                            <p>This website is my current project.  As I learn more about web development, I will continue to improve it.</p>
                            <p>The original version of this website, v1.0.0 on GitHub, was written using HTML, CSS, and PHP. It was designed with desktop browsers in mind. I wanted to improve my original design and make it mobile friendly, so I learned Bootstrap for v2.0.0.</p>
                            <p>I am currently learning jQuery and plan to use what I learn to make more changes.</p>
                            <p>The code for this website can be found on GitHub here:</p>
